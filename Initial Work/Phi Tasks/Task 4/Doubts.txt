Sir, regarding the API, how exactly are we supposed to define the functions for manipulating the quadtree?

I have taken several sessions on the API design watch the videos of those. 

Since, the quadtree is opaque, how the user is going to work with the tree. 
You will need to define functions like following using which one could create the tree, access and modify it's attributes, add, remove .. 

QuadTree_new
QuadTree_delete

QuadTree_getAttributeXYZ
QuadTree_setAttributeXYZ

QuadTree_insert
QuadTree_add
QuadTree_remove
QuadTree_query
QuadTree_foreach
